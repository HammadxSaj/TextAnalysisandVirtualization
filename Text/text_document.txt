The undergraduate level course on Finite Automata, Computability, and Complexity - titled
“The Nature of Computation” (CS 212) - is intended as a “pure theory”
1 course within the
Computer Science (CS) curriculum at Habib as well as at most CS departments in the
Western academic world. There are obvious political reasons for its inclusion in the
curriculum as well as some good pedagogical reasons. One of the latter being the study of a
subject for its own sake and without any specific research or scientific goals. However
theory in Computer Science serves a different purpose than theory in the natural sciences,
such as Physics. For one thing, theories in CS do not compete with other theories and
neither are they developed to reconcile empirical data [Ref. 2]. Hence students who study
the Nature of Computation course (CS 212) often have no precedent to relate to the subject
matter other than through pure mathematics.
CS academics often take pride in teaching “pure theory”, whereas students love to hate it.
There is a common understanding that CS departments focus more on theoretical
knowledge; the (pejorative) implication being that they focus on theoretical knowledge to
the detriment of practical knowledge. And such is the conundrum which the lead
investigator has also encountered while teaching CS 212. For the students, the course is
tedious and alienating from their worlds of practice. Thus a fissure is opened up between
theory and praxis which the instructors struggle to address - or perhaps they don’t possess
the relevant insights to address. Thus there is a vital need to conceptualize a rich response
to this issue.
But is it simply a problem of motivation that can be solved by motivating the theoretical
content through practical examples? Or is there a more fundamental issue with the course
content itself? These questions concern all parties - the teachers, the students as well as the
industry. Those who develop and disseminate the CS curriculum are themselves in need of
clarity and contextualisation regarding the goals of this course. Those who study it are
likewise seeking to resolve the apparent irrelevance and tedium of it. Those in industry and
the industry itself is poised to benefit from the student’s deep understanding of theoretical
knowledge. Hence this study aims to critically engage with the course and investigate the
questions that have opened up from multiple perspectives. We propose a cross-disciplinary
investigation into the history, politics and pedagogy of this course. Our aim is to propose
feasible design changes to the pedagogy as well as the content of the course.
